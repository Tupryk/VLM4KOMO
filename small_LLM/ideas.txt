Transformer for base objective structure
Diffusion model for continuous parameters
What are some herugistics for feasible/interesting komo problems?
Check that modeswitches only occur when the objects are touching.
Only include problems that change the enviroment (do we count just the robot?).
State of the config will influence if a komo probem is feasible, therefore the generators should eventually be conditioned on it.
Define a pdf for the target of each feature.
