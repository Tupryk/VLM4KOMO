pick(object_name)
- Generates a pick motion of an object
- Parameters:
- object_name (str): The name of the object to be picked
place(x, y, z)
- Generates a place motion of the robots object in hand, this means that a pick is first necessary
- Parameters:
- x (float): The absolute x target position to place the object
- y (float): The absolute y target position to place the object
- z (float): The absolute z target position to place the object
push(object_name, x_rel, y_rel)
- Generates a push motion of a specific object into a direction
- Parameters:
- object_name (str): The name of the object to be pushed
- x_rel (float): the relative x coordinate of the push
- y_rel (float): the relative y coordinate of the push
- Returns an object from which the following parameters can be queried: pos.X, pos.y, pos.Z, size-X, size.y, siz
e. z
- Parameters:
- object_name (str): The name of the object to be pushed
