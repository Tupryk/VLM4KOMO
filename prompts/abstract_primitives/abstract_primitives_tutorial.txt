The following text defines abstract primitive functions which are well defined already. You can use them for manipulating the robot arm as you like

pick(object_name, yaw)
- Generates a motion plan to pick an object to a target position
- Parameters:
  - object_name (str): The name of the object to be picked
  - yaw (float, optional): An optional parameter which defines the relative yaw angle of the robots end-effector to perform the pick

place(target, z_offset)
- Generates a place motion of the robots object in hand
- Parameters: 
  - target_position (list): The desired target position to place the object
  - z_offset (float, optional): An optional z offset to place on an elevated surface with respect to the table

push(object_name, target_position)
- Generates a motion plan to grasp an object at a specific frame and approach direction
- Parameters:
  - object_name (str): The name of the object to be grasped
  - target_position (list): The target x and y position of the push as a list
