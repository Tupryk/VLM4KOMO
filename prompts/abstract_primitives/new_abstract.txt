The following text defines abstract primitive functions which are well defined already. You can use them for manipulating the robot arm as you like

pick(object_name: str)
- Generates a motion plan to pick an object
- Parameters:
  - object_name (str): The frame name of the object to be picked.

place(x: float, y: float, z: float=.0, up_vec: str="z", yaw: float=None)
- Generates a place motion of the robot's object in hand
- Parameters:
  - x (float): Target position on the x axis.
  - y (float): Target position on the y axis.
  - z (float)(default: 0): Target position on the z axis, if 0 it will be on top of the table.
  - up_vec (str)(default: z): The vector in coordinate frame of the object to be pointing upward in the world frame, that is the vector in the object frame to be parallel to the world frame z vector.
  - yaw (float)(optional): The angle of rotation of the object with respect to it's up vector.

push(object_name: str, relative_x: float, relative_y: float)
- Generates a motion plan to push an object towards a relative position to the object
- Parameters:
  - object_name (str): The frame name of the object to be pushed.
  - relative_x (float): The relative target position on the x axis.
  - relative_y (float): The relative target position on the y axis.

getObj(object_name: str)
- Returns an object from which you can query the following parameters: pos.x, pos.y, pos.z, size.width, size.depth, size.height. The size parameters are relative to the world frame. Where the x axis is width, y is depth and z is height.
  - object_name (str): The frame name of the object to be queried.
