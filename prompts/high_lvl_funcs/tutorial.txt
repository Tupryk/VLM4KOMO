The following text defines abstract primitive functions which are well defined already. You can use them for manipulating the robot arm as you like

pick(object_name: str)
- Generates a motion plan to pick an object
- Parameters:
  - object_name (str): The frame name of the object to be picked.

place(x: float, y: float, z: float=.0, rotated: bool=False)
- Generates a place motion of the robot's object in hand
- Parameters:
  - x (float): Target position on the x axis.
  - y (float): Target position on the y axis.
  - z (float)(default: 0): Target position on the z axis, if 0 it will be on top of the table.
  - rotated (str)(default: False): Boolean to indicate if the object should be rotated.

push(object_name: str, relative_x: float, relative_y: float)
- Generates a motion plan to push an object towards a relative position to the object
- Parameters:
  - object_name (str): The frame name of the object to be pushed.
  - relative_x (float): The relative target position on the x axis.
  - relative_y (float): The relative target position on the y axis.

getObj(object_name: str)
- Returns an object from which you can query the following parameters: pos.x, pos.y, pos.z, size.x, size.y, size.z
  - object_name (str): The frame name of the object to be queried.
